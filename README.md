Proposal
========

Summary
-------

An intelligent voice interface that is able to listen and interpret what the
user has spoken. Input will be translated into text and stored in a Database.

Problem
-------

The problem this project solves is that it helps users take simple notes, such
as a grocery list or small reminders for when you don’t have a pen and paper
available. This project will help solved problems where people forget an
important detail or appointment, by storing what the user says into a readable
text format.

Similar to Apples Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana.

Description
-----------

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a Database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for *speech recognition and voice recording*. The
Database will store *what the user says in a readable format saved on a
Database*. The mobile device functionality will include *storage for the
recorded text and any reminders* and will be further detailed in the mobile
application proposal. we will be collaborating with the following
company/department, *we will not be collaborating with any companies at this
moment*. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production
Techniques independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319
Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in
CENG 355 Computer Systems Project.

Background
----------

There are several applications and hardware out there that utilize speech as
input, such as Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana or Amazon’s Alexa. Some other
hardware and software similar to our projects are Digital pens. This piece of
hardware records what users write down as input, and saves it in a text format
on the computer. In this era there is not much mention of using a person’s voice
as input, and has not been a part a person’s daily lives. You don’t see people
talking to their phone or microphone everywhere you look.

We have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read the below articles, which provides
insight into similar efforts.

The first article contains information related to text-to-speech output in
technology. [@5174430]

The second article’s information is about discriminating between vocal sounds
and environment sounds. [@7079726]

The third article relates to the behaviour of speech with service robots.
[@5565459]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of Databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable us to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology and Schedule
------------------------

Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the Winter term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that we have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Introduction
============

Objective
---------

The objective of this project is to create a usable voice interface that will
help people with organization and planning. In this current age of time a mobile
phone is carried everywhere and used 24/7. We want to utilize this aspect to
create a unique interface with a virtual voice to help others in planning. If a
piece of technology is with people the majority of the time, why not use that
technology in an effort to help them.

Technical Problem
-----------------

The problem solved by this project is that it helps users take simple notes,
such as a grocery list or small reminders for when you don’t have a pen and
paper available. This project will help solved problems where people forget an
important detail or appointment, by storing what the user says into a readable
text format.

Some problems that were encountered in constructing the Speech Buddy, was trying
to convert spoken words into text on the Raspberry Pi. We tackled this problem
by first utilizing the “espeak” library on the Pi. This did not provide enough
efficiency, until we discovered Amazon’s Alexa voice service. This voice service
allowed us to create specific tasks for the voice to do, making it easier to
program speech conversion, and database storage. Another problem was
connectivity, the Alexa voice service requires internet access, we have a wired
connection using an Ethernet cable. Portability is a big issue.

Project Description
===================

Database Specifications
-----------------------

### Database Type

Firebase is the Database type that is used for Speech Buddy. Firebase is a JSON
style Database that is organized via encrypted keys. It is incorporated directly
in android studio for ease of use with mobile applications wanting to store data
online.

### Database Tables

There are three tables that are used in the Firebase.

1.  Users

2.  ListNames

3.  ItemNames

**Users** is the table in which all users who sign up for our Speech Buddy
Application are stored. They are given a key as a unique identifier.

**ListNames** is the table in which the names of list the user created are
stored as strings. Each Users own Lists that they have created will be unique to
them via an identification key within the table.

**ItemNames** is the table in which the items under each list are stored. Each
Item is unique to the list name it was created under and the user that created
it via an identification key within the table.

### Database Alteration via User Case Examples

User case: The User Adds a list named “groceries” to their speech buddy.

Consequences: A string element “groceries” and key unique to the user are
generated in a new row under the ListNames table.

User case: The User Creates an Account with username <steve@abc.com> and
password “123”

Consequences: A string element (in mandatory email format) “steve\@abc.com”, a
string password “123” and key unique to the newly made user are generated in a
new row under the Users Table. All data manipulation under their account will
use this identifier, and they must use these credentials to access the
application.

User case: The User Adds an Item named “rice” to their “groceries” list.

Consequences: a string element “rice” and key unique to the user are generated
in a new row under the ListNames table.

Mobile Application Specifications
---------------------------------

### Graphical User Interface Specifications

**Login Activity:** The login screen of the application is the first presented
upon launching the application. The user may enter already existing credentials
into EditText fields and login, or may choose to go to the sign up activity,
both navigations via Buttons.

**Sign Up Activity:** The sign up screen of the application can be accessed from
the login menu. It has two EditText fields for new credentials to be added,
which upon submitting via Button will be verified by the username and password
guidelines and added to the user database. Incorrect EditText entries will be
communicated via Toast message asking for re-entry.

**List Activity:** The list activity of the application is comprised of a single
list, formatted appropriately, displayed across the width of the screen in both
portrait and landscape orientation. It loads it’s elements from the database
dynamically. If the list length exceeds the screen size, the list becomes
scrollable. The top right has the dropdown navigation menu, and add list/delete
list buttons.

**Items Activity:** The item activity of the application is comprised of a
single list, formatted appropriately, displayed across the width of the screen
in both portrait and landscape orientation. It loads it’s elements from the
database dynamically. The elements it loads are specific to the parent list and
user selected. If the list length exceeds the screen size, the list becomes
scrollable. The top right has the dropdown navigation menu, and add item/item
list buttons.

**About Application Activity:** A simple activity describing the purpose and
contributors of the Speech Buddy Application via formatted TextViews.

**Dropdown Navigation Menu:** In the top right corner of post-login activities.
Allows the user to Navigate to list pages, the about page, and logout. Also has
an option to clear all data from the current users records to start anew.

**Additional Note:** For ease of use, users may also press and hold list/item
elements to delete them. Any deleted list will also delete it’s child items.

### Database Integration

The Speech Buddy Application uses the integrated Firebase libraries in Android
Studio to connect to the database. Once connected online, it actively retrieves
data and adds dynamically updates the lists displayed within the application.
All new elements added to the users lists and items are independently added to
the database as soon as they are entered for optimal up to date accuracy within
the database.
