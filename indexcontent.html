	  <H3><b>SpeechBuddy Build Instructions</b></H3>
	  <H4>Introduction</H4>
		  <p>Speech Buddy is a voice interface intended to make storage and manipulation of data easier,
			  as well as perform simple various tasks via voice commands. It is intended to make simple
			  everyday tasks, such as adding items to your calendar, easier, as well as inquiries of online information.

	  <H4>Budget and Parts</H4>
	 <p>The parts and costs required to build speech buddy are as listed below:</p>

	 <H4>Case</H4>
	 <p>To build a Speech Buddy Case, download the json file below and upload it to: </p>
	 <a href = "www.makercase.com">makercase</a>
	 
	 <a href = "casemodel(10).json" download>Speech Buddy Case JSON File</a>
	 
	 <H4>Time taken to Build Speech Buddy</H4>
	 <p>Assuming you have to do no research as you are following my premade build method, The approxiamate time it will take to
	 build a working Speech Buddy is about four to five hours, assuming parts delivery time is not included.</p>
	 
	 <H4>Mechanical Assembly</H4>
	 <p>Setup your raspberry Pi by following the build instruction included in your kit. Connect your external speaker into
	 the pi's 3.5 mm jack and the USB microphone into a USB 2.0 slot. Use acrylic cement to bond case
         together. If you intent to put Speech Buddy permanently in it's case, it is important to wire the power cord through
	 the designated power slot in the case  before sealing the box.</p>

	  </video>
	 
	 <H4>Software Setup</H4>
	 <p>Ensure you have a fresh copy of Rasbian Jesse installed on your Micro SD card for your raspberry pi operating system.
	 Open a terminal on your Pi and type in the command "sudo alsamixer". Select Advanced Options, then Audio Options. Set to force
	 Output through 3.5mm jack.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Speech Buddy uses Amazon Voice Services. Make sure you have an amazon developer account before continuing, then follow the voice
	 services installation guide provided here:</p><a href = "https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Raspberry-Pi#lets-get-started">Amazon Voice Setup</a>
	 <p>Do Not install the wake word activation.<p>
	 
	 <H4>Power Up and Testing</H4>
	 <p>Run the Software to make speech buddy listen as directed above. Speech Buddy will output a basic tone if it is working.
	 It currently has basic capabilities such as simple mathmatic, google queries, and time and weather updates. Speech Buddy's location
	 may be incorrect. Test this by asking the curren time or weather, and change your location in your amazon profile accordingly.
	</p>
	 
	 <H4>A note for the future</H4>
	 <p>This guide builds a bare bones Speech Buddy with automatic feature includes in Amazon's Voice Service. I will be implementing
	 more capabilities and function to speech buddy in the future, as well as providing links to download these new abilites to add them
	 to your existing Speech Buddy</p>

	  	  	  <H3><b>SpeechBuddy Week 12 - Progress Report</b></H3>
		  <H4>Speech Buddy is now accepting voice input using the same Libraries as the Amazon Alexa. I have removed wake word
	  dependencies so I may create my own skills and code for an Independent Speech Buddy Platform.  It will use already existing
	  Libraries to perform basic activities, such as querying google, addition, current time, etc. I am incorporating my own skills
	  (Calenders, List) currently. I am finally caught up to my project plan and now may prepare for my presentation of a fully 
	  working prototype of Speech Buddy. My budget has changed however, as I had to purchase a new USB microphone for 14.99 because
	  of technical difficulties with the prior one. Because of this, though already purchased, the sound card would not be necessary
	  to include in the budget of prospective builders of Speech Buddy.Asides from the microphone issue, which was succesfully
	  resolved, no major obstacles were encountered and the project took a great step forward this week.</H4>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  	  <H3><b>SpeechBuddy Week 11 - Progress Report</b></H3>
		  <H4> Speech Buddy was shown at the open house, however without audio input as there were complications with the microphone.
	  		A keyboard was substituted to imitate voice input, but real voice input MUST be implemented by next week.
	  		A new microphone has arrived in the mail that should be able to successfully record voice input for interpretation on
			the speech buddy. After achieving voice input, our project will have a working sensor (voice), working hardware, and a working model,
	  		thus making us prepared for Systems Project.</H4>

	  <H3><b>SpeechBuddy Week 10 - Progress Report</b></H3>
		  <H4> Speech Buddy wil be shown at the open house this Saturday. It is currently capable of speaking through a
		  combination of a text to speech Python library, E-speak software, sound configuration file edits and self implemented code.
		  The next step will be to implement it's speech to text capabilities to recieve input through the microphone.</H4>

    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a
